# KAZO Marketplace Finance & Reconciliation Platform — PRD

## Original Problem Statement
KAZO Marketplace Finance Operating System — ingests marketplace reports, calculates expected charges, reconciles settlements, identifies leakage, manages recoveries. First connector: Myntra. Marketplace-agnostic core.

## User Choices (2026-02)
- Auth: Simple username/password (JWT, bcrypt), role-based (admin/finance/ops/viewer)
- File storage: MongoDB (uploaded XLSX parsed and stored as normalized rows)
- Frontend: React JS (agent's choice)
- AI insights: Deferred to a later iteration

## Iteration 2 — Production Hardening (2026-02, session 2)
User: "Make it production ready...no hard code no fallback. Make it ready for monthly reports to be uploaded in the formats. Please pre-configure the rules of Myntra and add them and create report based on the June data uploaded and rules given."

### Delivered in iteration 2
- **No fallbacks in the calculation engine** — every fee component either resolves to a strict rule match OR is left `null` with a specific `unmapped_reasons[]` entry. `unmapped=True` flag surfaces at row & aggregate level.
- **Configurable defaults instead of hardcoded values**:
  - Zone default (`Local / Zonal / National`) editable in Masters → Settlement Config; toggleable to force strict mode
  - GST / TCS / TDS rates editable in Masters → Tax Rates
  - Tolerance thresholds editable in Masters → Tolerance
- **Full 173-rule Myntra commission set** loaded from `/app/backend/data_myntra_commission_rules.json` (extracted from KAZO's own Myntra master file), with a `POST /api/masters/reset-defaults` (admin-only) to re-seed
- **Monthly report engine**:
  - `report_month` (YYYY-MM) extracted from `Month` / `Posting Date` / `Order Date` on every row
  - `GET /api/reports/months` — list of available months
  - `GET /api/reports/monthly?month=YYYY-MM` — full JSON aggregate (KPIs, category/sub-cat/zone breakdowns, reconciliation summary)
  - `GET /api/reports/monthly/export?month=YYYY-MM` — 7-sheet Excel workbook (Summary, By Category, By Sub-Category, By Zone, Order Detail, Discrepancies, Unmapped Orders)
- **Flexible file format handling** — parser scans headers with an alias table, picks the best-matching sheet automatically, requires `Order Id + SKU + NSV + Sub-Category` at minimum; rejects rows with placeholder "-" SKUs
- **Month filter** on dashboards, calculations, reconciliation, discrepancies
- **Admin-only guards** on all destructive master endpoints (POST/DELETE on commission-rules, fixed-fees, gt-charges, return-fees, subcat-levels, tolerance, tax-rates, settlement-settings, reset-defaults)
- **Format validation** — bad month strings (`bad-01`, etc.) return 400 instead of empty aggregates

### Verified on real data (Apr-26 file — 14,219 orders)
- 173 authoritative commission rules seeded
- 14,219 orders calculated
- **37 unmapped (0.26%)** — all `Clothing Set` variants missing from source master file; surfaced explicitly with reasons for ops
- ₹2.61 Cr NSV → ₹31.5 L expected commission (12.03%) → ₹1.94 Cr expected settlement (74.2% margin)
- Reconciliation on synthetic 296-row settlement: 231 matched, 65 variance, ₹1,264 recoverable

## Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Motor (Mongo async), JWT bcrypt auth
  - `server.py` — auth, JWT, admin seed
  - `deps.py` — `current_user`, `require_admin`
  - `routers/masters.py` — commission rules, fixed fee, GT, return fee, sub-cat level, tolerance, tax_rates, settlement_settings
  - `routers/uploads_r.py` — flexible XLSX parsers (sales/settlement) with alias-based header matching
  - `routers/calculations.py` — strict calc engine, unmapped detection, month tagging
  - `routers/reconciliation.py` — component-level compare, month propagation
  - `routers/dashboards.py` — KPI aggregates with month filter
  - `routers/reports.py` — monthly report JSON + Excel export
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + recharts
  - Pages: Login, Overview, Reports, Uploads, SalesLedger, Calculations, Reconciliation, Discrepancies, Masters
- **DB collections**: `users`, `uploads`, `sales`, `settlement`, `commission_rules`, `fixed_fees`, `gt_charges`, `return_fees`, `subcat_levels`, `tolerances`, `tax_rates`, `settlement_settings`, `calculations`, `discrepancies`, `recon_runs`
- **Indexes**: `report_month` on `sales`, `calculations`, `settlement`, `discrepancies`

## Test Results (iteration 2)
- Backend: **29/29 pytest passed** (15 legacy + 14 new production tests)
- Frontend: All new data-testids present and functional
- Security: auth guard + admin-only enforcement verified end-to-end

## Iteration 6 — Return rows dropped by parser (2026-07-21)
Reported: "the original April sales file also had return orders. those seem to have not got processed."

### Root cause
The raw file has 21,614 rows: 14,219 with `txn_type='Sales'` and **7,395 with `txn_type='Return'`**. Every return row has a **negative NSV / QTY** (Myntra's convention for reversals). The sales parser rejected all rows with `nsv_val < 0`, silently dropping the 7,395 return rows. Additionally, the previous classifier tagged both Sales+DTO and Return+DTO as `dto` — after importing returns, this would have double-counted refunds.

### Delivered in iteration 6
- **Parser** (`uploads_r._parse_sales_xlsx`): removed the negative-NSV rejection so Return rows import cleanly.
- **Classifier** (`_classify_order`): now emits **5 order types**:
  - `sales` — everything with `txn_type='Sales'` and no RTO/InternalCancellation status (includes Sales+DTO — the original sale record for a DTO order)
  - `return_dto` — `txn_type='Return' AND order_status='DTO'` — applies only Fixed Fee (incl GST) as Return Fee
  - `return` — any other `txn_type='Return'` (e.g. Return+Delivered, Return+Status NF) — sign-flipped with return fee from (level, zone) matrix
  - `rto` — any `order_status='RTO'` (Sales+RTO or Return+RTO) — all fees nullified
  - `internal_cancel` — any `order_status='Internal Cancellation'` — all fees nullified
- **compute_expected**: the `sales` branch now uses `abs(nsv_val)` (defensive); `return_dto` branch mirrors the old `dto` branch (fixed fee only). Net-effect for a DTO order across both Sales and Return rows = seller loses one fixed fee — matches the user's spec exactly.
- **Data reload**: uploaded raw file → 21,614 accepted / 0 rejected; recalculated all → distribution matches expected exact counts.

### Test Results (iteration 6)
- 21,614 sales rows imported (was 14,219; +7,395 returns now processed)
- Order-type distribution: sales=12,246 · return_dto=5,443 · rto=3,705 · internal_cancel=128 · return=92 (sums to 21,614 ✓)
- Aggregate April expected settlement: **₹4,631,550** (previously ₹16,575,054 which was inflated because returns weren't offsetting)
  - Sales: +₹14,690,173
  - Return DTO: −₹9,797,947
  - Return: −₹260,676
  - RTO / Internal Cancel: 0
- `testing_agent_v3_fork` iteration_6 PASS — no bugs, no action items.

## Iteration 5 — Bug-fix punchlist from CEO (2026-07-21)
Reported items:
1. NSV − GT amount = NSV-after-GT; all downstream calculations to use this base
2. Return transactions to be deducted (signed negative)
3. Search by Order ID not working
4. Commission Masters — download / upload option for configuration
5. Return Fee zonal charges to be considered
6. Sub-category → GTA charges level master
7. Return DTO — only fixed charges applied as return fee
8. RTO / Internal Cancellation — all fees nullified

### Delivered in iteration 5
- **Calculation engine rewrite (`compute_expected` + new `_classify_order`)**:
  - `order_type` ∈ {sales, return, dto, rto, internal_cancel} — classified by `order_status` (exact 'RTO' / 'Internal Cancellation' / 'DTO') and `txn_type` (contains 'return')
  - `nsv_after_gt = nsv_val − gt_charge` for sales; sign-flipped for returns/DTO
  - Commission base, TCS, TDS all computed on `nsv_after_gt` (previously used raw NSV)
  - **DTO**: only Fixed Fee (incl GST) applies, counted as Return Fee; everything else 0; expected_settlement = −|NSV| − FixedFeeInclGST
  - **RTO / Internal Cancellation**: every fee = 0; expected_settlement = 0; no unmapped flag
  - **Return**: all component signs reversed, plus return_fee (positive) from the (level, zone) matrix
  - New `nsv_after_gt` field in `breakdown` and top-level for reporting
- **Search fixes**:
  - Regex-escape `search` param on `/api/sales` and `/api/calculations` so UUIDs / meta-chars don't 500
  - Debounced search (400 ms) on both `SalesLedger.jsx` and `Calculations.jsx` — fires on every keystroke, not just Enter
- **Commission Masters download/upload**:
  - New `GET /api/masters/export` → single multi-sheet Excel with 8 sheets: Commission Rules, Fixed Fee, GT Charges, Return Fee, Sub-Cat Levels, Tolerance, Tax Rates, Settlement Config
  - New `POST /api/masters/import?mode=replace|merge` — round-trips the exported file; wipes/upserts collections; auto-invalidates cache
  - Masters page: `Download config` / `Upload (replace)` / `Upload (merge)` buttons with confirmation prompt

### Test Results (iteration 5)
- `testing_agent_v3_fork` iteration_5 → PASS. Verified DTO math (−6561.98 for the ₹6490 handbag test row), sales math (NSV-after-GT commission base), RTO/internal-cancel nullification, order-type classification on 14,219 rows, search-by-fragment on both Sales and Calculations, Masters download → import roundtrip (replace + merge). No bugs.

## Iteration 4 — Rebrand + Production Performance (2026-02, session 3)
User: "Pls add this logo.. powered by fundle on all pages... remove emergent mentions everywhere... all reports taking time to load... please help adding indexes on the DB and also compound indexing on all relevant fields... pls optimise reports dashboards and DB indexes fully for this to run smoothly on Production."

### Delivered in iteration 4
- **Rebrand to Fundle**:
  - Browser title → "KAZO Marketplace Finance · Powered by Fundle"
  - `Powered by [fundle logo]` badge on login page (data-testid `powered-by-fundle-login`) and in the sidebar footer of every authenticated page (data-testid `powered-by-fundle-sidebar`), linking to https://fundle.ai
  - Removed all `Emergent` references from rendered DOM: `index.html` title/description, PostHog block, `emergent-main.js` script, "Emergent Universal Key" text on `/insights`, and the dead `constants/testIds/` folder
- **Performance — DB indexes**:
  - Compound indexes on `sales` (report_month + sub_category / zone / order_status / txn_type)
  - Compound indexes on `calculations` (report_month + breakdown.sub_category / master_category / zone / unmapped / expected_settlement)
  - Compound indexes on `discrepancies` (report_month + severity, report_month + recoverable, recon_run_id + severity)
  - Compound indexes on `recovery_cases` (report_month + status / priority, recoverable_amount desc)
  - Compound indexes on `settlement` (report_month + online_order_id + sku)
  - Extra indexes on `insights_briefs` and `commission_rules`
- **Performance — parallelization**:
  - Dashboards (`overview`, `commission-summary`, `reconciliation-summary`) now run their sub-aggregations in parallel via `asyncio.gather`
  - Reports `_period_aggregate` runs 9 sub-queries in parallel (KPI, sales KPI, 4 group-bys, count, severity, recoverable)
- **Performance — caching**:
  - New `cache_utils.py`: in-memory TTL cache with tag-based invalidation
  - 30s TTL on all hot dashboard + reports endpoints, 60s on period lists
  - Auto-invalidation on writes: uploads (sales/settlement), delete-upload, run-calculations, run-reconciliation
- **Performance — transport**: GZipMiddleware enabled (minimum_size=1024)
- **Observed timings on preview**: cold 150–240ms, warm cached 106–140ms across dashboards + reports + insights + recovery

### Test Results (iteration 4)
- Testing agent verified: title/badges/anti-emergent DOM check across 11 routes, 7 endpoints cache-hot <1.5s with 2nd call ≤ 1st, GZip present, all required compound Mongo indexes exist, drill-downs regression pass. No bugs, no action items.

## Iteration 3 — Recovery Management + AI Insights (2026-02, session 3)
User: "go ahead and complete pending tasks" — deliver Phase 6 & Phase 7 from the backlog.

### Delivered in iteration 3
- **Phase 6 — Recovery Management** (new `routers/recovery.py`, new page `/recovery`)
  - Case tracking with statuses `open → in_review → submitted → recovered | rejected | closed`
  - Auto-create cases from open discrepancies (period-filtered, ₹>0 recoverable)
  - Manual case creation from any discrepancy via a new "Open Recovery Case" button in the Discrepancies drawer
  - Communication log (channel: note/email/call/chat/myntra_ticket, direction: inbound/outbound/internal)
  - Evidence file upload (≤15MB), download, delete — stored in Mongo (`recovery_evidence`, base64)
  - Summary endpoint: totals + by_status + by_priority + coverage % of discrepancy universe
  - Endpoints: `POST /api/recovery/cases`, `POST /api/recovery/cases/auto-create`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/recovery/cases/{id}`, `GET/POST /api/recovery/cases/{id}/notes`, `GET/POST /api/recovery/cases/{id}/evidence`, `GET /api/recovery/evidence/{id}/download`, `GET /api/recovery/summary`
  - New collections: `recovery_cases`, `recovery_notes`, `recovery_evidence` with indexes
- **Phase 7 — AI Insights** (new `routers/insights.py`, new page `/insights`)
  - Deterministic Health Score (0–100, Grade A–F) from four weighted components: Mapping (25%), Leakage (35%), Margin (25%), Recovery (15%)
  - Morning Finance Brief — Claude Sonnet 4.6 via Emergent Universal Key (`EMERGENT_LLM_KEY`), rule-based fallback when LLM unavailable
  - Radial gauge, per-component progress bars, tone selector (executive/operational/concise), audit log of past briefs
  - Endpoints: `GET /api/insights/health-score`, `POST /api/insights/morning-brief`, `GET /api/insights/briefs`
  - Numbers never fabricated — LLM receives only real aggregates from Mongo and is instructed to quote them verbatim
- **Fix** — `period_utils.month_query()` now tolerates missing `period_value` (returns `{}` instead of raising) so dashboards do not 500 on initial load

### Test Results (iteration 3)
- 10/10 new pytest tests pass covering Recovery + Insights (create, duplicate 409, PATCH transitions, notes, evidence upload/download/delete, LLM brief with source='llm', period switching)
- Frontend Recovery + Insights render correctly on 2026-04; Overview health-check regression passes
- Insights Morning Brief validated end-to-end with live Claude Sonnet 4.6 output
